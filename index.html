					<h1>How To Not<br>Get Dizzy</h1>
					<h4>Five Things Figure Skating Taught Me About Debugging My Life and Career</h4>

				<section>
					<p>From the age of 5 to 18 (?) I was a professional figure skater.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>I know that’s not news to most of you. I’ve talked about it on podcasts. It’s the first part of every bio you’ll ever read about me. I mean, it’s the title of this speech.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>If it’s not in the title of the speech you were expecting to see, you’re probably in the wrong room.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>When people find out I used to be a professional figure skater, they always ask me the same three questions.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>Can you do a triple axel?</li>
						<li class="fragment">Can you lift your leg over your head?</li>
						<li class="fragment">And how do you not get dizzy doing all those spins?</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Can you lift your leg over your head? (I usually get that one in bars.)</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>The answers to the first two questions are easy</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>No, but I can do a double axel.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Yes, I can lift my leg over my head, but if you’re the kind of person who asks me that, I can guarantee that you’ll never ever get to see it happen.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Then there’s the third question,<br><span class="emphasis">“How do you not get dizzy?”</span></h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Out on the ice, we’re spinning at more than<br>300 revolutions per minute; the same amount of centrifugal force they use to train astronauts.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Ever hear of the vomit comet?</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>It’s the simulator NASA uses to get astronauts ready for space.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Look on YouTube and you’ll see lots of big, tough jet pilots barfing their guts out.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Go to a competition any weekend and you’ll see twelve nine-year-olds spinning at least that fast and not a drop of vomit in sight.</p>
					<img src="img/spinning.gif">
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>How do we not get dizzy?</h2>
				</section>
					
				<section>
					<p>The first part of that answer’s easy,<br>and then it gets more complicated.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Let’s take the easy part first.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>How do we not get dizzy?</h3>
					<h3 class="fragment">Say it with me.</h3>
					<h2 class="fragment" style="color: #00BFFF;">Practice.</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Repetition creates muscle memory.</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>In my case, I’m talking about a whole lot of repetition; practicing morning, noon and night for hours, months and years. </p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Missing out on pretty much every childhood and teenage rite of passage.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>Lots and lots of falls,<br>sprains and breaks.</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>When I was (AGE) I broke my tailbone.<br>Do you know the worst thing about a broken tailbone?</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>There’s no cast.</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Think about it: if you break your wrist, people see your cast and ask what happened.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>When you’re hobbling around with a cane and a sore butt, people avoid eye contact and get the heck out of your way.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>They’re not sure if they want to hear the story. Well, they probably do want to hear the story. They just don’t know if they want to hear it from you.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Lesson #1:</h1>
					<h1 style="color: #00BFFF;">“Suck it up, Buttercup!”</h1>
					<aside class="notes"> 
						<p>Note: SHOUT IT LIKE A FOOTBALL COACH</p>
						</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>I had a coach that used to shout that at me. </p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>It stings when you’re 7,<br>but wow does it prepare you for life.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>If there’s one thing being a professional athlete teaches you, it’s how to lose.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>In life, just like in sports, you WILL lose.</p>
					<h2 style="font-style: italic;">Badly.</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Over and over again you’ll get your<br>butt handed to you.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>You’ll lose because you made a mistake,<br>because someone else made a mistake,<br>or for no discernable reason at all.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Suck it up, get used to it and get back on the ice.</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>I don’t mean get complacent.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>No one likes losing less than a professional athlete. It’s against our DNA.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>But it’s a fact of life.</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>The goal is to win more than you lose.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>If you think success means winning every single time, you’re in for a lifetime of disappointment.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>When it happens, accept the defeat as gracefully as possible and examine it to see what you could have done to either change the outcome or which red flags you missed along the way.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Show of hands –<br>how many people have managed to delete the production database?</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>You better believe my hand’s up.</p>
					<h2 style="font-style: italic;">Thank God for back-ups.</h2>
					<aside class="notes"> 
							<p>You may want to ask a few people what they learned from the experience. You’ll probably get some funny/ flip answers.</p>
							</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>The point is, we learned, and we lived to code another day.</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Get up, dust off yourself off and get back on the rink.</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Do it to show the doubters your resilience, but more importantly, to remind to yourself that the moments of our biggest defeats are also the seeds of our biggest triumphs.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>I love being an engineer.</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>It’s my passion and my tribe and it gives me purpose and hope and all the good stuff.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>As you can see, I get excited about it and I love getting other people excited about it.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>And this, all of this, my entire career, was born out of one of my biggest personal defeats.</p>
